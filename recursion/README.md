# Algorithms in Basic
1. Reversing characters with non tail recursive functions.
2. The nested sum function of h(n) = h(2 + h(n*2))
3. The Ackermann and Rozsa function to show growth with recursion

# Other Algorithms in recursion
## fibs.cpp
This contains both the recursive and iterative approach for fibs.
They both show the call count for each approach. Good, the iterative approach
is basically calculating each term from the beginning up to n and adding up. 
> It shows the very smaller amount of calls required with the iterative approach
of `n-1` instead of the `fib(n+1)-1` in the recursive form
