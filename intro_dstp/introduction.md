# Introduction to DSA

## Algorithms
These are stepwise instructions to solving a given problem.

### Rate of Growth
This is the rate at which the time of running an algorithm increases
as a function of the input. 

### Types of analysis
We have to check for the running time of an algorithm within the 
range of input that takes little to much time. Giving us:
- Worst case
- Best case
- Average case

> Lower Bound <= Average Time <= Upper Bound

## Asymptotic Notation
Let's represent the algorithm with f(n)

### Big-O Notation
This gives the tight upper bound of f(n). This is represented as
$$f(n) = O(g(n))$$
